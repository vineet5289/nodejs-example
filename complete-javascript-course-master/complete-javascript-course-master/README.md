# Course Material and FAQ for my Complete JavaScript Course

This repo contains starter files and the finished project files for all the projects contained in the course.

Plus, I made all the [course slides available for download](slides-students-C03.pdf), to make it easier to follow along the conceptual videos.

ðŸ‘‡ **_Please read the following Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) carefully before starting the course_** ðŸ‘‡

## FAQ

### Q1: How do I download the files?

**A:** If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the complete package, hit the green button saying "Clone or download", choose the "Download ZIP" option, and you're good to go.

### Q2: I'm stuck in one of the projects. Where do I get help?

**A:** Have you extensively tried fixing the problem on your own? If you failed at fixing it, please **post a detailled description of the problem to the Q&A area of that video over at Udemy**, along with a [codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/) containing your code. You will get help as fast as possible! Please don't send me a personal message or email to fix coding problems.

### Q3: Brackets shows me errors, but my code works. Why is that?

**A:** These are _not_ errors in your code, and you can simply ignore them (they just come from so-called linters that are not correctly set up).

### Q4: You keep mentioning your resources page. Where can I find it?

**A:** It's on my website at <http://codingheroes.io/resources>. You can subscribe for updates ðŸ˜‰

### Q5: What Brackets and VSCode themes are you using?

**A:** I use the theme "OS X Style | Flat & Dark" in Brackets and "Oceanic Next (dimmed bg)" in VSCode. [Here is the complete setup](editors-setup.md).

### Q6: Can I see a final version of the course projects?

**A:** Sure, I have an online version of all three. Here they are: [Pig Game](https://piggame2.netlify.com/) (DOM manipulation), [Budgety](http://budgety2.netlify.com/) (advanced JavaScript) and [Forkify](https://forkify.netlify.com/) (modern JavaScript and AJAX).

### Q7: Videos don't load, can you fix it?

**A:** Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about it. The course is hosted on Udemy's platform, and sometimes they have small technical issues like this one. Please just come back a bit later or [contact their support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).

### Q8: Videos are blurred / have low quality, can you fix it?

**A:** Please open video settings and change the quality from 'Auto' to another value, for example 720p. If that doesn't help, please [contact the Udemy support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).

### Q9: Are the videos downloadable?

**A:** Yes, I made all videos downloadable on the Udemy platform so you can learn even without an internet connection. To download a video, use the settings icon in the right bottom corner of the video player.

### Q10: I love your courses and want to get updates on new courses. How?

**A:** First, you can subscribe to my email list [at my website](http://codingheroes.io/newsletter). Plus, I make important announcements on twitter [@jonasschmedtman](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman), so you should definitely follow me there ðŸ”¥

### Q11: How do I get my certificate of completion?

**A:** A certificate of completion is provided by Udemy after you complete 100% of the course. After completing the course, just click on the "Your progress" indicator in the top right-hand corner of the course page. If you want to change your name on the certificate, please [contact the Udemy support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).

### Q12: Do you accept pull requests?

**A:** No, for the simple reason that I want this repository to contain the _exact_ same code that is shown in the videos. However, please feel free to add an issue if you found one.
